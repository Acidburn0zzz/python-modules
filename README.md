Python modules
=========================
These files are used and required by some of the Python scripts available in the other repositories.

For FontLab scripts, put these files in `[...]/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/System/Modules`.
For the remaining scripts, put these files in the same folder as the script, or put them in one of the folders listed by `sys.path`.
